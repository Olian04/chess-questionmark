Replay Match could have an indication that whether I resigned or lost.
Ranking is confusing, seems like it's relevant to 1500 other users. Maybe it should be renamed as Points.
Frustrating that it is impossible to win. Even in case of draw or stalemate, you will have to resign and it will show up as a loss.
Like the color scheme and minimal design.
The Settings icon looks like it's a button.

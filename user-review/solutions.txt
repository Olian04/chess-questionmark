We got feedback from multiple users which highlighted a few issues:
	It was hard to tell what color they were playing as, it was confusing to sometimes be black.
		Solution: Make the user interact with the notification.
	
	Some non-buttons looked like buttons which was confusing.
		Solution: Remove the button-like design pattern.
	
	It was not intuitive that the match history had clickable replays.
		Solution: Change the title from rechent matches to replays.
	
	It was not intuitive what the rank meant, no sure if it is relative to other users.
		Solution: Change the text from rank to points.
	
	Can not click on the board, only allowed to drag pieces.
		Solution: Make it possible to move pieces by clicking.
		
	Unclear when the king is in danger.
		Solution: Highlight the king square with red if it is in danger.
	
	It was very difficult to beat the AI.
		Solution: Make stockfish skill level scale based on user rating.
	
Also some bugs that were fixed:
	Logging in could go to a blank screen.
	Stockfish would sometimes stop responding with no user feedback.
